# E-Commerce Data Insights Dashboard

  Gain comprehensive, actionable insights into your e-commerce platformâ€™s sales, user behavior, product performance, and review ratings. This project uses a robust data analysis workflow to power an interactive Streamlit dashboard and data visualizations.

## Project Overview


This project involves end-to-end data exploration, cleaning, analysis, and visualization of an e-commerce dataset containing information about users, products, orders, and reviews. It culminates in an interactive Streamlit dashboard that presents:

- Sales trends and patterns
- Product category performance
- Customer purchase behavior
- Ratings and reviews insights

## Features

- **Clean & Explore Raw Data:** Preprocessing, merging, and basic statistics.

- **Sales Analysis:**
  -  Top-selling products and their quantities

  - Revenue breakdown by product category

  - Identifying peak hours of sales activity

- **User Insights:**
  - Repeat purchase rate calculation

  - High-value customer ranking

  - Most highly rated products
- **Review Analysis:** Aggregate and visualize customer review ratings.

- **Interactive Dashboard:** Filter, drill down, and visualize KPIs using Streamlit and Plotly.

- **Custom Theming:** Visually appealing layout and color scheme via config.toml.

## 1. Data Exploration & Cleaning

- Handled missing values and duplicates.
- Merged product price into order details.
- Calculated `TotalAmount = Quantity Ã— Price`.
- Converted datetime columns to proper `datetime` formats.
- Created derived features like `Hour` of sale.

The cleaned dataset is saved as cleaned_orders.csv for further analysis and dashboard integration.

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Key analyses and visualizations include:

- Top 10 Best-Selling Products: Horizontal bar chart.

- Revenue Distribution by Category: Pie chart.

- Hourly Sales Trend: Line chart.

- Repeat Customer Rate: Percentage of users with >1 purchase.

- Top High-Value Customers: Bar chart by total spend.

- Product Review Ratings: Top 10 products by customer rating.

### Sample Output Visualizations
Here are a few visualizations from the analysis:

![Category Sales](https://github.com/Hariharan-T27/shopper-insights/blob/main/E-Commerce%20Data%20Insights/output%20images/Pie%20Chart.png)
![Hourly Sales](output_images/hourly_sales.png)
![Top Customers](output_images/top_customers.png)
![Top Ratings](output_images/top_ratings.png)

## 3. Interactive Dashboard (script.py)

Built with **Streamlit** and Plotly for instant interactivity.

**KPIs:** Revenue, orders, unique users, average product rating.

**Filters:** Segment analyses by product category.

**Visualizations:** All EDA insights available interactively.

**Dark & Light Mode:** Based on theme settings in config.toml.
